Description: TP53 germline mutations are the main cause of Li-Fraumeni syndrome. This package is designed to estimate probabilities that:  1) the counselee is a TP53 germline mutation carrier, 2) the counselee develops any cancer in future, 3) the counselee develops breast cancer, sarcoma or any other cancers in future, 4) the counselee develops a first or second primary cancer in future, on the basis of his/her family cancer history. The package also provides functions for using the LFS classic and Chompret criteria.
